				(default value is empty string)

				(default value is 000..)

				by two beats

Options
=======

melodyonly 		When this is non zero (string value), do not add the notes on ! and .
				while still advancing the pointers.

noeffects 		When this is non zero dump the modifiers (/^v) and modify the note immediately,
				before creating it. This effectively removes those effects.
