===========================================================================

Fretting values are 0-9 t:10 e:11 w:12 h:13 u:14 v:15 x:16 v:17 g:18 n:19

(<name>)		Set the display chord to <name>
				(default value is empty string)

[fffff]			Set the current fretting. Can be '.' for don't play this string.
				(default value is .....)

{ssssssss}		Plucking pattern, strings 1-5. Can be '.' for don't pluck this half beat
				(One character per half beat, (default value is .. x beats)

* 				Play one half beat, extracting the note from the current fretting and current 
				string above. So once you've set fretting and strings your bar can
				just be ********

&				Advance one half beat but generates no music, a half rest.

+ - > 			Apply pull on, hammer off or slide of 1 semitone to the last defined note
				in the current bar - error if none is defined.

f 				As * but uses this fretting and the string selected using @n (below), generates
				a single half beat note.

@n 				Set the current string for overrides. The default is the 5th string.

^				Play the clawhammer over one beat, e.g. the current chord for 1/2 beat and open
				string 5 for half a beat

%<name>%		Macro expansion. Replace <name> with defined value.

Note values set for [] {} and @ persist over bars, being set to the default value for the first bar.
