===========================================================================

Fretting values are 0-9 t:10 e:11 w:12 h:13 u:14 v:15 x:16 v:17 g:18 n:19

(<name>)		Set the display chord to <name>

[fffff]			Set the current fretting. Can be '.' for don't play this string.

{ssssssss}		Plucking pattern, strings 1-5. Can be '.' for don't pluck this half beat
				(One character per half beat)

* 				Play one half beat, extracting the note from the current fretting and current 
				string (unless overridden). So once you've set fretting and strings your bar can
				just be ********

&				Advance one half beat but generates no music, a half rest.

+ - > 			Apply pull on, hammer off or slide of 1 semitone to the previous defined note
				in the bar.

f 				Overrides the next '*' only setting the fretting to f and using the current string
				rather than getting it from the plucking pattern.

@n 				Set the current string for overrides.

^				Play the clawhammer over one beat, e.g. the current chord for 1/2 beat and open
				string 5 for half a beat

%<name>%		Macro expansion. Replace <name> with defined value.
